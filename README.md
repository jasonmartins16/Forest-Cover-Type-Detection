# Forest-Cover-Type-Detection
This project predicts the type of forest cover for a given land patch using geospatial and terrain-based features. The model is trained on analysis data from the Roosevelt National Forest in northern Colorado and classifies land into seven forest cover types (e.g., Spruce/Fir, Aspen, Douglas-fir, etc.).
